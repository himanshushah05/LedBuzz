## What it does
![What_it_does](./what_it_does)
<p> LedBuzz is a simple See-through display made using NodeMCU. It can be used for getting any type of notification alerts just by looking at your ceiling fan. You can add your future alarms using the app. After adding the data, you will see the text message on the fan. We even have a webserver which can be used to adjust the RPM of the motor.(if conncected on an external DC motor.) </p>
